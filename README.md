 We spent an enourmous amount of human-hours trying to fire up Cassandra to work with Spark and failed, coming back to MongoDB..

## Design

Our system consists of several containerized components, all orchestrated using a single Docker Compose setup. The components are as follows:

1. **Kafka**: We chose Kafka as our message queue due to our familiarity with it and its ease of setup and debugging. We created a topic called `crypto_data` and a Producer that writes data from a WebSocket to this topic.
2. **WebSocket Microservice**: This microservice continuously streams data to our Kafka topic `crypto_data`.
3. **MongoDB**: We use MongoDB as our database to store the processed data. We choose mongo beacause data stream that we receive from the websocekt might have different structure and document based DBs behave well in such cases.
4. **Spark**: Spark is utilized for both stream and batch processing of data.
5. **Spark Stream Processing**: This container processes messages from the Kafka topic. It formats the messages and writes them to the `raw_transactions` collection in MongoDB.
6. **Spark Batch Processing**: This container aggregates data according to specified requirements and writes the results to the `aggregated_transactions` collection in MongoDB.
7. **REST API Microservice**: This microservice provides REST API endpoints to access the data in our database and return it via GET requests. It uses Pythond and FastAPI framework. We choose it because we know python and FastAPI is a very comprehensive and handy framework.

Each component is designed to work together seamlessly, ensuring efficient data processing and retrieval.
